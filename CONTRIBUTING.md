# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve the Roo Research Swarm!

## Ground Rules
- Keep artifacts **schema-compliant** (see `/schemas`).
- Do not commit proprietary `.roomodes`. Provide **patch instructions** instead.
- Snapshot web evidence into `/project/{pid}/evidence/{hash}.(html|pdf)` and reference the hash in verification files.

## Pull Requests
- Include a short description and why the change is needed.
- Run `scripts/verify-schemas.py` before opening a PR.
